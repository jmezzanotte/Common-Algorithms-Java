Staircase.java
- Solution to the common programming problem of printing a staircase with N number of steps. I wrote a recursive function to solve this problem. After seeing solutions with many complicated loops, I wanted to write something concise with no nested loops. I came up with this recursive structure to solve the problem. The solution involves a recursive helper function that does all of the work. 

Matrix
- This class provides some really simple matrix operations. I'm still working with this one so the functionality of the class is still somewhat limited. Right now this class allows you to create a multidimensional array and then provides some static methods that allow you to print out the matrix as well as find the absolute diagonal difference of the matrix. I created this class originally as a solution to the  diagonal difference problem. The method that solves this problem is called absDiagnalDifference. It is a static method that takes a multidimensional array as a parameter.
