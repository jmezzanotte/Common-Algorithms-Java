- Solution to the common programming problem of printing a staircase with N number of steps. I wrote a recursive function to solve this problem. After seeing solutions with many complicated loops, I wanted to write something concise with no nested loops. I came up with this recursive structure to solve the problem. The solution involves a recursive helper function that does all of the work.
